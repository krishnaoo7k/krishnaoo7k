# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm a Java Developer with experience in Spring Boot, Hibernate, Docker and PostgreSQL, Created <br>multiple projects using these techs. I enjoy building APIs and working with databases. I‚Äôm always learning<br>and excited to grow my skills in backend development. Open to new opportunities!<br><br>Fun Fact about Java :)<br>Java was almost named "Oak" after a tree outside the office window of Java's creator, James Gosling. <br>He wanted to name it Oak because he loved that tree, but the name was already taken by another <br>technology. Eventually, it was renamed Java, inspired by the coffee from Java Island in Indonesia, since<br>coffee was a big part of the programmers' culture!<br><br>So, that's why the Java logo has a coffee cup on it! ‚òï
