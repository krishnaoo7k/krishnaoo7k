# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm a Java Developer with experience in Spring Boot, <br>Hibernate, Docker and PostgreSQL, Created multiple projects <br>using these techs. I enjoy building APIs and working with <br>databases. I‚Äôm always learning and excited to grow my<br>skills in backend development. Open to new opportunities!<br><br>Fun Fact about Java :)<br>Java was almost named "Oak" after a tree outside the <br>office window of Java's creator, James Gosling. He wanted<br>to name it Oak because he loved that tree, but the name<br>was already taken by another technology. Eventually, <br>it was renamed Java, inspired by the coffee from Java <br>Island in Indonesia, since coffee was a big part of the <br>programmers' culture!<br><br>So, that's why the Java logo has a coffee cup on it! ‚òï
